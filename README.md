# Hi 👋🏾, I'm Ibraheem

## 👨‍💻 Software Engineer | 🚀 Tech Leader | 🔍 Innovator

Born and raised in Texas, now based in New York City, I've built my career at the intersection of technology and business innovation. My journey began with a marketing degree from UT Austin, which gave me a unique perspective on how technology serves users. This foundation led me through diverse roles - from investment banking at Barclays to managing user acquisition for major mobile game franchises at Zynga, and eventually to pioneering tech work at industry leaders like LinkedIn.

### 💼 Professional Journey

During my five-plus years at LinkedIn, I played a key role in developing LinkedIn News, enhancing how millions of professionals discover and engage with current events and industry insights. I contributed to the News Module on the homepage and implemented critical features for the platform's search functionality. My experience spans the full tech stack, from building responsive UIs to developing robust backend systems using TypeScript, JavaScript frameworks, Python, and cloud infrastructure including AWS and Azure.

### 💡 Philosophy

I love creating tech that brings people together and makes information more accessible. For me, the best solutions aren't just functional—they're beautiful and meaningful. While pushing for innovation, I never compromise on security and compliance.
